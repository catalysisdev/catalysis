# Renderer

Although Gestalt defaults to [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for its declarative [UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) layer,
it supports other UI technologies (e.g., [React](https://reactjs.org/)) through renderers.
A renderer instructs Gestalt on how to transpile templates (e.g. JSX files) by providing [Vite plugins](https://vitejs.dev/plugins/).
Moreover, it offers routing components and the logic for rendering UI client and server-side.
