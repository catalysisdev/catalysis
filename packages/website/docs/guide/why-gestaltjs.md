# Why GestaltJS?

**The web empowers creators to build and share their craft with the world.**
It's become the foundation for new forms of value exchange to emerge,
which in turn led to further innovation through new technologies and tools.
Layers of abstractions aimed to ease the process of building,
which paradoxically made it more overwhelming due to the amount of options available.
Crafters often find themselves spending more time figuring out the right tools for the job and setting them up to have an integrated experience.
They struggle to gain **creative momentum**,
and that's necessary for great ideas to flourish.

**GestaltJS builds upon simplicity to create a space for crafters to gain building momentum.**
We are a framework for building desktop and web apps and sites with web technologies.
We [make simple things simple, and complex things possible](goodreads.com/quotes/8636264-simple-things-should-be-simple-complex-things-should-be-possible),
and we achieve so through a set of conventions and abstractions that [conceptually compress](https://m.signalvnoise.com/conceptual-compression-means-beginners-dont-need-to-know-sql-hallelujah/) intricacies.
You'll experience the same throughout our documentation.
We refrain from using terminology and concepts that might make you feel like you don't know enough.
**We understand complexity to offer a simple and enjoyable development experience.**
You are the creators,
we are the plumbers.


Moreover,
we provide a set of **beautifully-integrated batteries** for projects' common needs.
