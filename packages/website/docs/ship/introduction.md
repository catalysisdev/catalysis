# Introduction

Crafting software is comprised of two phases: **building and distributing**.
The latter gets your creations in the hands of users,
and it's often referred to as *deployments* or just *shipping code*.
Since Gestalt focuses on the building phase,
when the distribution time comes,
crafters have to explore deployment solutions,
decide on one that's the most indicate for their projects,
and integrate it into their development workflow.
**Ship** takes the decision-making off you by providing a distribution solution that integrates seamlessly with Gestalt.
In other words, it's a deployment as a service solution.

Ship is powered by Gestalt,
which allows [dog-fooding the framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) to get ideas for improvements and new features. Users can deploy and maintain an instance of Ship to their infrastructure or use our paid hosted solution.
The latter is recommended to financially support the project. The income generated by subscriptions is re-invested in the shape of paid mentorships.
Mentees are a great source of ideas and energy that are key to building a diverse tool.
