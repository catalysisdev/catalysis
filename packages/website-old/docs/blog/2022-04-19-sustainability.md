# Open-source sustainability through empowerment

One of the principles that we are embracing in [Gestalt](https://gestaltjs.org/) is **longevity**. We want the framework to outlast projects’ lifecycle to make it a safe choice for software crafters. It won’t be easy in this fast-paced world and environment we find ourselves in, but we love challenges.

**How can we build a framework that sustains itself well over time?**

Sustainability in open-source is a complex topic without easy solutions. Some projects die because the maintainer's attention span is limited, and they eventually burn out. Others make the wrong technical decisions or take shortcuts early, which sets them in the wrong direction. Some projects embrace the Silicon Valley model. They build for the short-term reward of their investors through marketing that sells them as reasonable long-term solutions.

It's common to solve the sustainability problem by adding a new variable to the equation: money. However, money is a double-edged sword. While it allows paying maintainers a salary to turn maintenance into a full-time job. It presents another set of problems that are often disregarded. For example, how to use it effectively to have a high impact on the project or dealing with conflicts around perceived unfairness around how money is distributed. Moreover, it might end up shadowing intrinsic motivators like mastery or purpose.

We want to take a radically different approach with Gestalt. We believe that human energy is crucial to sustaining the project, so **we'll empower users and contributors to the project**. We'll create an environment that puts **extrinsic motivators** front and center and trusts its maintainers and contributors to steer the boat in the right direction. We'll make ourselves dispensable through excellent documentation and code architecture, a solid test suite, and a diverse community of people keen to help each other and contribute to making Gestalt better every day.

The above is possible thanks partly to having a well-paid job at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) where I do what I love the most, building tools for developers, and that inspires me to positively impact the world.

**Open-source is our way of giving to the world without expecting anything in return. We love it.**
