# Security Policy
The Gestalt repo is scanned frequently for code and dependency vulnerabilities. Notifications are received by the Redwood Core Team members, who assess risk, prioritize, and determine a remediation plan. Typically this process involves a package update or patch release and is resolved within 24 hours of notification.

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue, do let us know as soon as possible. We'll work toward a resolution as quickly as possible, so please provide us with a reasonable amount of time before disclosure to the public or a third-party.

Thank you for helping improve Gestalt security!

## Security is Everyone's Responsibility
We take security seriously. Which is why we offer a friendly reminder that "Gestalt Framework Security" **!=** "Security of Applications built with Gestalt"

It's our responsibility (Core Team members) to implement security best practices and make the framework as secure as possible. We will do as much as we can; however, we can only do so much. Ultimately, security rests in the hands of the application developers who use Gestalt. If you haven't already, we recommend starting the security process for your application with [GitHub's Security Tools and Best Practices](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/managing-security-vulnerabilities-in-your-project).
