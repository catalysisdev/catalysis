# 2022.09.01 PNPM as the default package manager

The Javascript ecosystem is well known for its fragmentation. There are several tools and solutions to the problems at any layer, and that's the case for package management, where we find [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Technically, we could allow users to use any of them. However, even though there's standardization in the `package.json`, there are notable inconsistencies in the approach to organizing packages and making them importable. Those inconsistencies might worsen the experience contributing to and using Catalysis, so we decided to form a strong opinion on the package manager being used.

We discarded NPM due to its performance. This is indeed one of the motivations that led to the creation of Yarn. We think Yarn is a significant improvement in performance and developer experience. However, they adopted an unconventional strategy for importing modules, [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp), which might present some incompatibilities with industry tools. Many organizations, for instance, remain in Yarn 1.x for that reason.

We decided on [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) because it's fast, follows a conventional approach for organizing packages, uses symlinks over copying files leading to more reliable dependency installations, and prevents [silly bugs](https://www.kochan.io/nodejs/pnpms-strictness-helps-to-avoid-silly-bugs.html) from happening. Moreover, large projects like [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) have successfully adopted it at their scale. We believe it's a sensible trade-off for contributors and users of Catalysis.
